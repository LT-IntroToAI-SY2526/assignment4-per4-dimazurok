# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    The most difficult part of creatint tic-tac-toe was keeping track of the game logic. I had to check sure that all the winning combinations and  drawing combinations were included. Testing these was tricky because tic-tac-toe might seem like a small game but there are a lot of different combinations the board could end.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    In order to add a computer player to the game, I would modify the play tic-tac-toe function so that one of turns is automatically handled by the program, instead of user input. The computer could be programed to make a random valid move or we can make it more advanced by programing the computer to make a strategic move.   
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    In order to make the computer player make the best move possible, I would use a strategy or algorithim for the computer to make the best move. The computer could look ahead at all the possible moves and see what would work and what wouldn't. Then it could pick a move that leads it to a win, or blocking the user from winning. And if there isn't  any win or block avaiable then it would pick the move that is good for the next round.
